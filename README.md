## Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- Frontend:
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - React.js for building the user interface
  - Redux for state management
  - Axios for making API requests

- Backend:
  - Node.js for the server environment
  - Express.js as the web application framework
  - MongoDB for the database
  - Mongoose for object modeling
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication

- Deployment:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Nginx as the reverse proxy
  - AWS S3 for static file storage (images)

## Features

The Ecommerce Website comes with the following features:

- User authentication and registration.
- User roles (e.g., admin and regular user) with different access permissions.
- Product listing with search and filter functionality.
- Product details page with images, descriptions, and reviews.
- Shopping cart management (add/remove items, update quantities).
- Checkout process with payment integration (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).
- Order history and tracking for registered users.
- Admin dashboard to manage products, categories, and orders.
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.

## Installation

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and provide the necessary configurations for the database, JWT secret, and payment gateway (if applicable).

4. Start the development servers:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

To use the website, access it through your web browser using the URL provided by the local development server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). You can explore the available products, add them to your cart, proceed to checkout, and manage your orders.

If you have admin access (achieved by setting the appropriate user role), you can access the admin dashboard to manage products, categories, and view order details.
